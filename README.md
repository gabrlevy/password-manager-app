# password-manager-app
Password manager app made in Python with a tkinter GUI



For better use insert your own email or username in line 72 where the dummy email is.

Once you generate the password it automatically copies it. Just paste on whatever site you are going to use and log the information in the app.

Finally all your passwords and info will be saved in a txt file in the local repository. Be sure to move it somewhere else if you so prefer.
